        <h2 id="business">Business Administrator</h2>
        <p class="describe">In today’s competitive workforce, most jobs require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree from
            an accredited university. A business degree, however, provides you with a specific skill sets array needed
            to ensure you get the career of your dreams. A business degree will help improve and perfect your
            communication, presentation, and written skills, as well as your critical and creative thinking skills.
            Plus, a four-year business degree will help your personal development – you will learn how to deal with
            ethical issues, how to interact with others and demonstrate sensitivity, how to exercise leadership and
            work as a team, but also how to adapt to uncertainty. Essentially, a business administration degree is a
            perfect resume-building degree! Plus, the degree is transferrable and is considered an asset in almost any
            field.<cite>---by Algoma University.</cite></p>

        <h2 id="software">Software developer</h2>
        <p class="describe">Technology is a game-changer. It’s the most disruptive industry in history. One reason why
            software is so disruptive is that it has the potential to automate previously tedious tasks that required a
            human oversight and approach; human processes that are intrinsically prone to human error. With new
            technologies come new solutions. Since the late 70s, software development has rapidly evolved – no longer
            bottlenecked by the precarious indisposition of technology not being able to evolve at the same scale.
            There’s never been a more exciting time in history to get involved in this industry.<cite>---by Nicole
                Nelson</cite></p>

        <h2 id="farmer">Farmer</h2>
        <p class="describe">The agricultural farmer is the one responsible for the production and marketing of the food
            of every country. The specific nature of work of each agricultural farmer depends according to the type of
            farming. For instance, in livestock farming, the farmer is mainly responsible for taking care of animals
            and the daily tasks include planning and controlling pastures. In crop farming, farmers prepare and
            fertilize the soil, make sure crops are protected against diseases, and harvest ready crops for processing
            and marketing. Products that are usually processed and marketed are meat, dairy products, and wool. An
            agricultural farmer can also be an employer who employs laborers according to the size of his or her farm.<cite>---by
